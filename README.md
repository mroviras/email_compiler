# Email compiler
### AIM:
Python code to download emails of different web email accounts into a single database. 

### OUTPUT: 
CSV file with all emails and an html copy of all emails and attachments.

### CONTEXT:

I developed this code to conduct an online correspondence audit field experiment. Feel free to reach me if you would like to talk about how to implement it in a similar experiment.

This work was supported by the British Academy [PF19\100020]; the European Union-NextGenerationEU, Ministry of Universities and Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan, through a call from Pompeu Fabra University [Maria Zambrano Fellowship]; and the Oxford’s Sociology Department ‘Inspiration Fund 2022’. 

### NOTES: 
  · I used 'Dreamhost' to purchase web domain hosts that included email use. I guess the code can be used with other web domains. 
  
  · All emails should have the same password. 
  
  · This is the first code I share publicly. Please, feel free to reach me to suggest any improvements.
